# Progress Log — Project Caravela
# REQ-037.2: All implementation deviations must also be recorded in changelog.md.
# Update status at the start and end of each work session.
# Statuses: not started | in progress | complete | blocked

## How to use
- Set status to `in progress` when you begin work on a requirement.
- Set status to `complete` when the requirement passes its acceptance criteria (tests pass, deliverable committed).
- Set status to `blocked` and fill in the Blocked By column when a dependency or open question prevents progress.
- If implementation deviates from the BRD, mark Deviation = Yes and add an entry to `changelog.md`.
- Link ADRs in Notes for any requirement where a significant decision was made.
